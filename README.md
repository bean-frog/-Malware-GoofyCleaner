Download the .zip or .tar.gz archive from the releases tab (this will not harm your computer automatically unless you execute the .sh script)<br>
send your victim "Instructions.txt" and "SystemCleaner.sh" you can rename this file as well<br>
if they complain to you over discord, text, or another chat application, carefully type the letters "c", "o", "p", and "e", then press the enter key<br>
if they complain verbally, simply say it worked for you <br>
